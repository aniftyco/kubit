# Example Skeleton

This shows how an app would be structured and coded in Kubit.

- Routes: `app/routes.ts`
- Controllers: `app/controllers/*`
- Views (React pages): `views/*`
- Components: `components/*`
- Config: `config/app.ts`
- Migrations: `database/migrations/*`
- Jobs: `app/jobs/*`
- Mail: `app/mail/*`

Note: The `kubit` CLI and runtime are not implemented yet; this is a design target used to drive the framework via
tests.
