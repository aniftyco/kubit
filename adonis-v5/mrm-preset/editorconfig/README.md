### Editorconfig file
Creates a `.editorconfig` file inside the project root. The editor config file is a way to keep the editor settings consistent regardless of the the editor you open the files in.

You may need a [plugin](https://editorconfig.org/#download) for your editor to make `editorconfig` work.

The file is generated with settings defined inside the [task file](https://github.com/adonisjs/mrm-preset/blob/master/editorconfig/index.js#L20) and again is not customizable.
